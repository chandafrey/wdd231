                and pattern to only accept alpha characters, hyphens, and spaces with a minimum of seven (7) characters using a regular expression -->

                <!-----------PATTERN------------------------ 
                [...] → Character Set

                    The square brackets mean:
                    “Match one character that is inside this list.”

                    Inside your brackets:

                    A-Za-z → matches uppercase A–Z and lowercase a–z

                    \- → matches a literal hyphen (-)
                    (the backslash \ escapes the hyphen so it’s not seen as a range)

                    ' ' (space) → matches a literal space

                    ✅ So [A-Za-z\- ] means:

                    “Allow letters, hyphens, and spaces.”

                    {7,} → Quantifier

                    Curly braces mean “how many times should the previous thing repeat?”

                    7, means “seven or more times.”

                    ✅ So {7,} means:

                    “There must be at least 7 characters total (but no maximum).”

                    🧠 Putting It Together

                    [A-Za-z\- ]{7,} means:

                    “Accept only letters, spaces, or hyphens, and there must be at least 7 characters total.”

                    ✅ Example Matches

                    ✔️ "Manager" ✅ (7 letters, only letters allowed)
                    ✔️ "Assistant Director" ✅ (letters + space, more than 7 characters)
                    ✔️ "Co-Founder" ✅ (letters + hyphen, more than 7 characters)

                    ❌ Example Non-Matches

                    ❌ "CEO" ❌ (only 3 characters, fails minimum length)
                    ❌ "VP-1" ❌ (contains a number, which is not allowed)
                    ❌ "Boss!" ❌ (contains !, not allowed) -->
